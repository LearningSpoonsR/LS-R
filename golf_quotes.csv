Bobby Jones,Golf is the closest game to the game we call life. You get bad breaks from good shots; you get good breaks from bad shots - but you have to play the ball where it lies.
Bobby Jones (1960). ¡°Golf is My Game¡±,"The main idea in golf as in life, I suppose is to learn to accept what cannot be altered and to keep on doing one's own reasoned and resolute best whether the prospect be bleak or rosy."
Bobby Jones,Competitive golf is played mainly on a five-and-a-half-inch course... the space between your ears.
Bobby Jones,You might as well praise a man for not robbing a bank as to praise him for playing by the rules.

Bobby Jones,No-one will ever have golf under his thumb. No round ever will be so good it could not have been better. Perhaps this is why golf is the greatest of games. You are not playing a human adversary; you a playing a game. You are playing old man par.
